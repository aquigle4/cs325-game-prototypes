<h2>Spider Librarian (Movement Test)</h2>
    <h3>Controls: <ul><li>On the ground: a/d move you left and right and space jumps, Click the mouse to try and create a web line and press e to try to attach to a web line near your cursor.</li>
        <li>
            On a Web: A/D to move left or right along the web, spacebar to dettach.
        </li></ul></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    Well I hope that it's a realtivly unique movment Mechanic
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    More dealing with phaser's lack of ray casting! yay!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    A bunch of fancy ways of dealing with the lines,Angles, And velocity
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    The hardest part was getting the on-web movement working, I eventualy found physics.arcade.velocity from angle, but for a while there it was a mess of trig functions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Loading screen: self-made</li>
    <li>In-Game Background: <a href = https://www.vladstudio.com/wallpaper/?library> from vladStudio</a></li>
<li>Button: Phaser example <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Action On Click</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>I did most of this without an example and the code is self-written</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    You are a spiderperson Librarian, you must use your skills as a spider person and a librarian to do a good job.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    n/a for this prototype
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    It's all the same for this prototype, platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    The movement for the next, much more game-y prototype step
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
"Oh hey this movment mechanic isn't awful" Is kind of all I was going for with this one.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Right now: just see the controls
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
 N/a as the game's like conflict loop isn't in.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    For now you are a spider person (Represented by a white box) who works as a librarian in a tower-like magic library.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The other students of this class?
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Since the gameplay loop isn't really in, like 15 seconds.
</li>
