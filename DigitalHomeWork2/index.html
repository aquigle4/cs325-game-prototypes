<h2>Space Geology</h2>
<h3> Left/Right Arrow keys to go counterclockwise/clockwise around the planet, and up arrow key to jump away.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
    Simulating Gravitational pull and moving around (atleast the top half) of the planet normally.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
    Basics of phaser, p2 physics, p2 polygon collider data
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
    A lot of trig math
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>

    Space Background: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T40NSkd7Olc/maxresdefault.jpg<br>
    Everything else is done with Piskel.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.<br>
    I'm using a little bit of code from the "Accelerate to object" phaser p2 example, and while I don't think I copy-pasted any code I did use a few examples from <br> Various p2 Polygon physics examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The plan is to have space person collect space rocks
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    n/a
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    none
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    Most of it was just trying to get moving around the planetoid to work, let alone do so in a satisfying manner.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The idea is to have the player on this planetoid and have falling meteroids/meteors that they have to avoid being hit by as they fall, than collect once they've settled, but I don't have the meteors in yet, so it's just a movement prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Bob and weave, The meteors would spawn pretty high up and randomly so it's a bad idea to 'jump/float' to far or one might spawn on top of you
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a space geologist, and for some divinly mandated reason, this prototype must be about you, doing geology things, in space.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The students, TAs and Teacher of CS325 at george mason university.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br>
    The plan is for there to be a minute~ timer to collect as many space rocks as possible.
</li>
